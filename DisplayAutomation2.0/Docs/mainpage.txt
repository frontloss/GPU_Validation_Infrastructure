\section Introduction
--------------------
DisplayAutomation2.0 is  the automation framework used for validation of Display features. \n
Tests are primarily written in Python aided by underlying libraries or helper functions written in Python and/or C.\n

<b>Folder-Structure</b>
-----------------
'bin' will contain all C DLLs & external tools \n
'Docs' contains tools for code documentation generation and coding guidelines \n
'Libs' contains the common libraries, which can be used by the tests \n
'Logs' folder will be the location of log generation, once test completes \n
'registers' contain the python headers for all hw registers \n
'Samples' contain few code test samples to refer as to how to use any library and write a test. \n
'Setup' folder contain the pre-requisite installer for DisplayAutomation2.0 \n
'Src' contains the 'C' DLL source code projects. \n
'Tests' folder contains the test scripts, sub-foldered as individual features \n

<b>Pre-requisites</b>
---------------
Run 'build64.bat' from root folder to generate all DLLs in 'bin' folder. This needs to be done on a machine with VS2013 installed. \n
Run 'setup.bat' on the Target machine from DisplayAutomation2.0 root. This install all required packages to run the test. \n
Run 'env_setup.bat' to initialize the environment variables. This will restart the machine. \n
From DisplayAutomation2.0, run any test with following sample commandline. \n
	python Tests/DisplaySwitch/apply_configuration_ddc.py -edp_a

<b>To-Do</b>
------
New 'C' based DLL needs to be added as part of Src/MasterSolution.sln and will be automatically built by build64.bat \n
Follow python unittest framework for test script coding. \n
Good to run sanity_check.py before checking-in the code; sanity_check.py will check for any inclusion errors \n
Create and update feature.xml in Tests/Feature when a new test is added, modified or a new commandline is updated. \n

<b>Not-To-Do</b>
----------
Dont check-in the dll along with the source, since dll building will be taken care by 'build64.bat' \n
