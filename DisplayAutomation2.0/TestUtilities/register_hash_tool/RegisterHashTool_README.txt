Problem statement:
******************
During CRC enabling on pre-silicon environment CRC values were not matching between FULSIM and EMULATOR. We were in need of tool to compare
the register state of the Display engine between FULSIM and EMULATOR. Otherwise comparison was done manually which was cumbersome and error prone.


Solution:
*********
An automated tool was envision to eliminate the manual operation of comparing register state between two different pre-silicon environment. Register hash tool has been developed to read the complete register state and compare the register state.


Design Overview:
****************
DisplaySequence.xml file is a file used by SV team for there internal validation and generated by HW team. This XML file contains complete meta deatils of all the registers for Display Engine. 

For better control, XML file is transformed in to JSON format and later converted into CSV to bucketize/categorize the registers. For e.g. all the plane related register will go under the Plane bucket. The categorization detail is re-used from DisplaySequence.xml for better maintainability.

The Read operation will happen on each bucket type which contains numerous related registers. And the comparison operation will compare each bucket and report the delta. Further optimization has been done by HASHING the register state (all registers) to reduce the number of comparisons.
